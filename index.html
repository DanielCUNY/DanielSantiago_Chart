<p>Mario Peña, a 43 year-old from the Dominican Republic never expected to find himself walking along thea
NYC streets without a home. A job in construction brought him to the big city when he was 2o years old and
with him, many dreams that now seem too far away to reach.</p>

<p>Peña is a homosexual man who left his native country in 1998 to explore a life filled with
acceptance and changes in New York City. "When I got here [NYC] I wanted to work, fall in love,
and build a family. Now I only have this", he says referring to a bag filled with clothes and
jackets that help him keep warm in the cold weather that already is covering the east coast of the
United States.</p>

<p>After ending his last relationship and losing his job in construction because of the Covid-19 pandemic,
Mario Peña finds himself without a home and resources.</p>
<p> Like him, there are many LGBTQ+ people who experience homelesness. Many also experience food insecurity.</p>


<p>Food insecurity is "not having food to eat or not knowing where your next meal is going to come from"
as stated by the Department of Social Services from the state of New York.</p>
<p>13.1% of LGBTQ+ adults in the United States have lived in a household that has experienced or are currently experiencing food insecurity.
in comparison to the 7.2% of people who do not identify as LGBTQ+.</p>

<p>Although an issue that affects the LGBTQ+ community (whether lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or other) the census bureau published data that states that "straight" households
suffer food insecurity at higher rates.</p>

<p>When asked about statistics, Camesha Grant, on a previos interview with Spectrum News said, "There is no doubt that in NYC LGBTQ+ people are not the bigger community impacted by this [food insecurity.]" ... "Traditional or straight homes suffer from this as well,
the data shows this, but the data also reflects that they surveyed more people from these communities and not as many from minorities" ... "The priority should be feeding people."

<p>Food Bank NYC is an non-profit organization that helps communities experiencing this issue in NYC. Their mission
is to provide food at no cost to people in need, but they have a program called "Fight on Feed All" that is directly targeted to members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Their primary location is at 116th Street in West Harlem where Camesha Grant, vicepresident and communications
director explained that they have always cared about giving a plate of food to people who don't have access to one.
"Members of the LGBTQ+ community have always been beneficiaries of our services and we want to support them, no matter the reason why the visit us." said Grant.</p>

<p>Today, Food Bank NYC's services can be accessed through "Grubhub" a delivery app where people can request free food from the organization."</p>

<p>At the FBNYC's community kitchen Peña while having vegetables and roasted chicken said "I don't always come here, but
when I do they treat me very well, don't judge me, don't ask questions, they just give me food.I don't know if I will eat tomorrow, but today I'm thankful of places like this."</p>

<p>New York City offers help to people experiencing food insecurity, no matter if they identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community or not.
The city is making a call to action to people who need help to apply for "SNAP" through the website or via phone to avoid in-person contact because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The pandemic has also played a big role in people suffering financial issues that result in homelesness and food insecurity.
The Williams Institute of the UCLA's School of Law says that 27% of the population that identifies as LGBTQ+ in the United States
(more than 13,042,000) reported experiencing no food or lack of access to food in the past year.</p>

<p>21% of LGBTQ+ people in NYC (from more than 900,000) experience food insecurity.</p>

<p>Jennifer Shaoul, executive director of Disability Affairs at the Department of Social Services in New York City
said "[that food insecurity] is a big issue in the city and doesn't get talked about as much as it should." Shaoul, highlighted programs
that the city offers like "SNAP" to facilitate access to food." ... "There is no reason to be ashamed, we all need food" affirmed Shaoul on the
importance of asking for help.</p>

<p>Mario Peña, who has not yet applied for "SNAP" benefits or asked for help from the city s waiting to get out of the streets soon, find a job, and ask for help to
receive benefits that will allow him to have food everyday.</p>
